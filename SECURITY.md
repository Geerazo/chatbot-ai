# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We apply security fixes on the `main` branch and the latest tagged release.  
Older releases may receive fixes on a best-effort basis.

| Version         | Supported |
|-----------------|-----------|
| main / latest   | ✅        |
| older releases  | ⚠️ best-effort |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please email **eerazo83@gmail.com** with:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce / PoC (minimal, if possible).
- Affected commit/tag, environment and OS.

**Please do not open public issues** for vulnerabilities.

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgement:** within 72 hours.
- **Triage & initial assessment:** within 5 business days.
- **Fix ETA:** shared after triage; critical issues prioritized.

We may request additional information and a secure channel for sharing PoCs.

## Disclosure
- We follow **coordinated disclosure**. We will release a fix and then publish details.
- If the issue also affects third-party dependencies, we may coordinate with their maintainers.

## Scope
This policy covers code and configs in this repository (application, configuration, and docs).  
Infrastructure not owned by the maintainers (e.g., user deployments) is out of scope.

## Safe Harbor
We will not pursue legal action for good-faith, non-disruptive testing that respects privacy, avoids data exfiltration, and follows the steps above.
